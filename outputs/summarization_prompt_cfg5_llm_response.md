Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are flexible deep‑learning models that can compress images, clean noisy data, create new samples, spot outliers, and fill in missing parts. The article shows how a simple VAE built in PyTorch works on the MNIST handwritten‑digit set, walking through the encoder‑decoder design, the re‑parameterization trick, and the combined reconstruction‑plus‑KL loss. It then demonstrates five practical uses—compression, generation, denoising, anomaly detection, and imputation—using clear visual examples. The write‑up gives enough detail for a curious reader to see how VAEs operate and decide if they want to try them on their own data.
