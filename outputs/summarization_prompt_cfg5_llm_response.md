Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are versatile deep‑learning models that can be used for tasks such as data compression, noise reduction, synthetic data generation, anomaly detection, and missing‑data imputation. This publication shows how VAEs work on the MNIST handwritten‑digit set, giving practical tips for AI/ML practitioners. It walks through the core ideas, the PyTorch code, and five real‑world uses, emphasizing the model’s flexibility and ability to create new data. The article also points to future research and practice opportunities and encourages readers to keep experimenting with VAEs.
