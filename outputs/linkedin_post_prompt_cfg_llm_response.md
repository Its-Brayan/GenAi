Curious how one model can handle five different tasks? I just read a clear guide on Variational Autoencoders that shows exactly that.  

Using the MNIST digit set, the author walks through practical examples in PyTorch. The same VAE compresses images to a tiny latent vector, then rebuilds them with almost no loss. It also creates brand‑new digits, cleans noisy pictures, spots out‑of‑distribution samples, and fills in missing pixels.  

The code is short and the concepts are explained without heavy math. What I liked most is the focus on real‑world uses – from reducing storage needs to detecting anomalies in sensor data. If you work with any kind of data, give VAEs a try. The notebook is a good starting point and the ideas can be adapted to images, tabular records or time series.  

The article also hints at future extensions, such as applying VAEs to medical scans or autonomous‑driving sensors. I’m planning to test it on my own project and will post updates.
